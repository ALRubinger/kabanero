= Creating Dual Layer Docker images for Spring Boot apps
Michael Thompson <https://github.com/barecode>

In the first part of this blog post series https://openliberty.io/blog/2018/06/29/optimizing-spring-boot-for-docker.html[Optimizing Spring Boot apps for Docker] we looked at the single layer approach to building Docker images for Spring Boot applications and the implications it has for CI/CD pipelines.
I proposed that a dual layer approach has concrete benefits over the single layer approach and that these benefits are in the form of efficiencies in iterative development environments.

Here we introduce an approach to creating dual layer Docker images for existing Spring Boot applications using a new tool in Open Liberty called `springBootUtility`.
There is are alternate approaches to creating Docker layers for Spring Boot applications[1].
This approach focuses on creating a dual layered image from the existing JAR rather than altering a maven or gradle build step.

== The Dual Layer Approach
In the dual layer approach, we structure the Docker image such that the binary dependencies of the Spring Boot app exist in a layer below the application code.
By pushing the infrequently changing binary dependencies down into a separate layer, and keeping only the application classes in the top layer, iterative rebuilds and re-deployments will be much faster.

In order to accomplish this, we need a way to split the Spring Boot application into these components.
Enter the `springBootUtility`.

== The `springBootUtility`
The `springBootUtility` is a new tool in Open Liberty which will split the Spring Boot JAR into two parts: the binary dependencies, such as the Spring Boot starters and other third-party libraries, and the application code.
The binary dependencies are placed in a library cache and the application code is used to construct a thin app.
The thin app contains a file which references the libraries it needs on the classpath.

== Docker multi-stage builds
The Dockerfile used to build this dual layer image uses a feature of Docker called https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds[multi-stage builds].
Multi-stage builds allow a single Dockerfile to create multiple images, where the contents of one image can be copied into another image.
This allows you to drastically reduce the size of your final image, without needing to involve multiple Docker files.
We use this function to split the JAR file entirely within the Docker build process and complete the build with a single image.

== The Docker base image
The Docker base image used in this approach is http://openjdk.java.net/[Open JDK] with https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[Open J9] and https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty].
Open JDK provides a solid foundation of open source Java technology.
Open J9 brings along some performance improvements over the default java virtual machine included with Open JDK.

== The Details
Using Docker’s multi-stage build and the `springBootUtility` in Open Liberty, the Dockerfile splits the Spring Boot JAR.  

First, we install unzip.
Next, we download Open Liberty and stage in some configuration for Open Liberty.
All of this prep work is needed to get the Open Liberty tool in place.
We know its pretty ugly, that's one of the things we'll be improving in the very near future.

Once the image has all of the tools it needs, the JAR file is copied into the image and split.
After the thin app is created under `/staging/myFatApp.jar`, a further optimization step is taken to unzip it.
This unzip allows subsequent rebuilds to get a Docker cache hit.

Now that the staging work is done, the last step is to copy over the important bits to the final image.
This results in the larger binary dependency layer (34.2MB) and the smaller application layer (1.01MB).

Now when application changes are made and the Spring Boot application is rebuilt and repackaged as a Docker image, only the application layer needs to be changed.

== Try it out!
You can copy this Dockerfile and run it on your own clone of Pet Clinic.

`$ docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=target/spring-petclinic-2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar -t openlibertyio/spring-petclinic .`

The resulting Docker image looks like this:

image::/img/blog/blog_optimizing_spring_boot_dual_layer_with_liberty.png[align="center",Diagram of a dual layer Docker image for a Spring Boot application based on Open J9 and Open Liberty.]

You will notice that the entire Docker image isn’t as small as if the base image was `openjdk:8-jdk-alpine` - we’re working on improving that.

== Future Steps
We’re happy with what we’ve built so far but, to be honest, the user experience of building these images isn’t great.
It can be done better, and we’ll be working on that in the coming months.
We'll also be publishing Docker images which contain a pre-configured Open Liberty instance.
That will significantly reduce the complexity of the Dockerfile.

We also recognize that there is room for improvement when integrating these dual layer builds in a continuous delivery pipeline.
That's another aspect of improving the Spring Boot experience for Docker we're interested in solving.

Lastly, this approach to splitting out static binary dependencies from the application code is not exclusive to Spring Boot applications!
Similar efficiencies can also be applied to Java EE or MicroProfile applications.
That's another area we're exploring.
