= Writing cloud-native Java with MicroProfile

https://microprofile.io/[Eclipse MicroProfile] is a modular set of technologies designed for writing cloud-native Java microservices. The Open Liberty guides take you through each of the MicroProfile technologies to build simple microservices running on Open Liberty.

== Cloud-native Java with MicroProfile

Cloud-native applications are designed to run in a cloud environment. Develop cloud-native applications using agile practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery to streamline deployment, design them around modular, team-aligned microservices, and push them to the cloud for rapid deployment at scale.

MicroProfile enables you to build and deploy cloud-native Java applications as loosely-coupled, lightweight services, each representing one unique business function. This approach is modular and makes the application easy to understand, easy to develop, and easy to test. It also enables small, autonomous teams to develop, deploy, and scale their respective services independently.

MicroProfile is a set of industry standard technologies for developing cloud-native Java applications. It is based on a small number of Java EE technologies (JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P), on top of which you can add the specific technologies that you need for your cloud-native Java application.

|Build RESTful web services
|The JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P Java EE technologies provide the base for MicroProfile. If you're new to Java EE and MicroProfile, this is a good place to start.
|https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service]

https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html[Injecting dependencies into microservices]

|Consuming a RESTful web service with type-safe Java
|MicroProfile Rest Client provides a type-safe approach for invoking RESTful services over HTTP.  This API greatly simplifies the client-side API as defined by JAX-RS. MicroProfile Rest Client handles the communication between the client and service.
|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client.html[Consuming RESTful services with template interfaces]

|Document your RESTful APIs
|MicroProfile OpenAPI provides a Java API for the OpenAPI specification that you can use to expose API documentation for your RESTful APIs.  You can natively produce OpenAPI documents from their JAX-RS applications. OpenAPI https://swagger.io/blog/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/[started off as the Swagger specification].
|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-openapi.html[Documenting RESTful APIs]

|Handle unexpected failures in your microservices
|MicroProfile Fault Tolerance provides an API and annotations for building robust behavior to cope with unexpected failures in your microservice.  Aspects of fault-tolerant execution include timeouts, retries, fallbacks, bulkhead processing, and circuit breakers.
|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-fallback.html[Building fault-tolerant microservices]

https://openliberty.io/guides/circuit-breaker.html[Preventing repeated failed calls to microservices (interactive)]

|Authentication and role-based access control
|MicroProfile JWT provides for interoperable authentication and role-based access control in Java.  Allows for an authenticated JWT token to be shared across multiple microservices--even if these services are running on multiple vendorsâ€™ implementations.
|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-jwt.html[Securing microservices with JSON Web Tokens]

|Externalize configuration to improve portability
|MicroProfile Config externalizes configuration from the application to improve portability of the application. A core principle is to be able to override configuration at deployment time using system properties and environment variables.

|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[Configuring microservices]

https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[Separating configuration from code in microservices (interactive)]

|Determine a microservice's availability
|MicroProfile Health Check provides a common REST endpoint format to determine whether a microservice is alive or not.

|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-health.html[Adding health reports to microservices]

|Monitor a microservice's telemetry data
|MicroProfile Metrics provides common REST endpoints for monitoring a running microservice's telemetry data. Similar in nature to JMX but a much simpler API using JAX-RS.  Both built-in and application-defined metrics are accessible, with the output in either JSON or Prometheus text formats.  This API provides more extensive detail than the simple up/down reporting provided by MicroProfile Health.
|https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[Providing metrics from a microservice]




|Enable distributed tracing of your microservices
|MicroProfile OpenTracing allows services to easily participate in a distributed tracing environment.  OpenTracing defines behaviors and an API for accessing an http://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing]-compliant Tracer object within your microservice.  These trace logs can then be consumed by a third-party distributed tracing facility such as https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin] or https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger[Jaeger].
